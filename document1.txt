Soduku Project

 solve Sudoku with a backtracking algorithm
    Steps are:
    1.  get all allowed numbers that fit in each empty cell
    2.  generate all possible rows that fit in the first row depend on the allowed number list
    3.  select one row from possible row list and put it in the first row
    4.  go to next row and find all possible number that fit in each cell
    5.  generate all possible row fit in this row then go to step 3 until reach the last row or there aren't any possible rows left
    6.  if next row hasn't any possible left then go the previous row and try the next possibility from possibility rows' list
    7.  if the last row has reached and a row fit in it has found then the grid has solved
